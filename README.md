# Introduction

This is the user interface for a TODO list project that I am currently building. When completed, the project will consist of:

 * A web UI built in Angular
 * A mobile app built with React Native; and
 * An API written in .NET Core

For the API, please see: 

https://github.com/JakeM321/todo-list-backend

The aim of this project is to demonstrate my capabilities in the above-listed stack, as well as in the following areas:

 * SSO and user/session management with JWT
 * Secure password management
 * Pushing notifications and updates from server-to-client via websockets
 * Responsive user interface design
 * CI/CD setup
 * Serverless architecture
 * Scalability (the app will be designed to handle a high volume of users)
 * Unit testing
 * Functional and reactive programming
 * Object-oriented programming
 * SOLID principals

Unit testing has been included above, however since this project is not being approached with a concrete design, I have opted for a TLD approach over TDD.

# Angular project information

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.9.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Mock mode

Run `ng-serve --mock` to run the dev server in mock mode. In mock mode, all back-end dependencies are replaced with mock data, allowing the UI to be debugged without an API to support it.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
